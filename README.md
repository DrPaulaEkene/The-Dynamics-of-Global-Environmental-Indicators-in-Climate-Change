Clustering and Fitting of climate change indicators(Emphasis on renewable energy)


Overview
This project investigates global environmental indicators with a focus on renewable energy consumption and urban population dynamics over a 30-year period. Using K-Means clustering, countries are categorized into distinctive groups based on their environmental metrics. The study further explores future trends of renewable energy consumption in key countries using polynomial fitting methods, providing valuable insights into the trajectories of sustainability and urbanization.


Project Objectives

Cluster Analysis: Employ K-Means clustering to segment countries into groups according to their levels of renewable energy consumption and urbanization.

Predictive Analysis: Use polynomial regression to predict future trends in renewable energy consumption for selected countries.

Insight Generation: Analyze and interpret the patterns emerging from the data to understand how different nations approach the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development.


Key Findings

Distinct Clusters Identified: The analysis delineated three clusters:

Cluster A: High renewable energy consumption with lower urban population percentages.

Cluster B: Higher urban population percentages but moderate renewable energy consumption.

Cluster C: Lower levels of both renewable energy consumption and urban population.


Country Specific Insights:

China (Cluster B): Expected to see significant growth in renewable energy consumption by 2030 due to ambitious energy reforms amidst rapid urbanization.

Germany (Cluster A): Predicted to continue its leadership in renewable energy consumption with a substantial increase by 2030.

Nigeria (Cluster C): Forecasted to experience a decline in renewable energy consumption, suggesting a need for targeted policy interventions.


Technologies Used

Python with libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn for clustering and statistical analysis.

Data Visualization: Detailed charts and graphs illustrating the clustering results and predictive trends.
